## Description
For this exercise create an application using the Vue Javascript Framework.  This application should be free of errors and satisfy all the requirements outlined below.  All source code related to this project should be stored in a public git repo on Github. 3rd party dependencies do not need to be included in the repo, however someone should be able to easily install the required dependencies and run the application with the files included in this repo.

## Requirements
One page of the application should display a table of the values found in `users.json`.  By default this table should display all rows with a white background.  On the same page there should be a button.  When this button is clicked all user rows with a login count of 0 should have a red background.  When the button is clicked again all records should have a white background.

A separate page of the application should display a table of the values found in `users.json`.  By default this table should display all rows with a white background.  On the same page there should be a button.  When this button is clicked all user rows with a login count greater than or equal to 1 should have a green background.  When the button is clicked again all records should have a white background.
